# A simple way to track pending tasks...


## Basic commands:
 iotawallet tx-show <TXHASH>
 iotawallet bundle-show <BUNDLEHASH|TAILHASH>
 iotawallet generate-address <SECURITY> <KEYINDEX> - I think this needs to be done locally. Maybe we can use the current rust api for this
 iotawallet send <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS> <AMOUNT>


##DONE:
iotawallet balance <ADDRESS>
iotawallet tx-status <TXHASH>



Is `bundle-show` the same as findTransactions?
And `tx-show` ?
